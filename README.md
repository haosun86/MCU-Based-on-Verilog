# MCU-Based-on-Verilog
This project will implement MCU based on verilog language.
It aims to achieve Cortex-R5 performance on some aspects, such as Dhrystone, CoreMark, and other specific floating-point benchmark.
The MCU will have the following features:
1. Support RV32I base instruction set.
2. Support "M" standard extension.
3. Support "F" standard extension.
4. Support "A" standard extenstion.
5. Possibiy add custom cache maintenance instruction.
6. With I-Cache and D-Cache.
7. Support WFI to enter low power mode.
